Effective CPU Utilization: 2.0% (1.447 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 36
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.559s (49.9% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 8.1% (2.912 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 4.3% (3.107 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
     |
Memory Bound: 55.2% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.

Effective CPU Utilization: 3.3% (2.392 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 18
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.330s (39.3% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective CPU Utilization: 3.0% (2.162 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 9
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.180s (32.7% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 15.8% (5.697 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 4.0% (2.848 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.570s (46.3% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or

     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,

 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical

Effective CPU Utilization: 2.5% (1.774 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 18
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.280s (29.5% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 19.7% (7.080 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.8% (2.023 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores

Effective CPU Utilization: 2.9% (2.112 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 9
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.130s (16.2% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 16.1% (5.781 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.9% (2.102 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 4.8% (1.744 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.4% (1.744 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first

Effective CPU Utilization: 1.6% (1.129 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 36
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.660s (39.3% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 5.8% (2.104 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.8% (1.993 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
     |
Memory Bound: 32.1% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of

Effective CPU Utilization: 1.8% (1.329 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 18
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.390s (28.5% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective CPU Utilization: 1.9% (1.335 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Total Thread Count: 9

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.170s (14.7% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or

 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical

Effective CPU Utilization: 1.5% (1.068 out of 72 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

    Total Thread Count: 36

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.679s (20.1% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 0.400s (13.0% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 3.9% (1.395 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 1.6% (1.180 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
     |
Memory Bound: 16.3% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 3.4% (1.233 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 1.6% (1.166 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
