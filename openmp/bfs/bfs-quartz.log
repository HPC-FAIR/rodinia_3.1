    Spin and Overhead Time: 17.461s (85.6% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 16.403s (86.4% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 16.968s (87.9% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 10.340s (99.7% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-

    Spin and Overhead Time: 10.050s (99.9% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 10.320s (99.9% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 10.120s (99.9% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

    Average CPU Frequency: 2.961 GHz 
    Total Thread Count: 72
Effective Physical Core Utilization: 1.0% (0.363 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 0.5% (0.363 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 3.8% (1.355 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.7% (1.946 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.

     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or

     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,

    Spin and Overhead Time: 12.490s (99.1% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.
