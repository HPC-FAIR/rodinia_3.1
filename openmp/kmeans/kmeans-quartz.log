     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 2.0% (0.702 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.

    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 0.8% (0.562 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first

Memory Bound: 54.9% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 100.0% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.

     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or

     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for

     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.
     |
    DRAM Bound: 40.8% of Clockticks
     | The metric value is high. This indicates that a significant fraction of
     | cycles could be stalled on the main memory (DRAM) because of demand loads
     | or stores.

     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.
     |
     | A significant portion of CPU time is spent in synchronization or
     | threading overhead. Consider increasing task granularity or the scope of

     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 6.1% (2.190 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.9% (2.109 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.

    Serial Time (outside parallel regions): 0.611s (82.2%)

Memory Bound: 56.0% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 48.8% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.

Memory Bound: 55.6% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of

    Cache Bound: 3.8% of Clockticks
    DRAM Bound: 39.0% of Clockticks
     | The metric value is high. This indicates that a significant fraction of
     | cycles could be stalled on the main memory (DRAM) because of demand loads
     | or stores.
     |
     | The code is memory bandwidth bound, which means that there are a
     | significant fraction of cycles during which the bandwidth limits of the

     | Improve data accesses to reduce cacheline transfers from/to memory using
     | these possible techniques: 1) consume all bytes of each cacheline before
     | it is evicted (for example, reorder structure elements and split non-hot
     | ones); 2) merge compute-limited and bandwidth-limited loops; 3) use NUMA

     | The code is latency bound, which means that there are a significant

 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism

    Average CPU Frequency: 2.634 GHz 
    Total Thread Count: 36
Effective Physical Core Utilization: 14.0% (5.027 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 10.5% (7.565 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of

Memory Bound: 65.5% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 54.8% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 10.4% (3.751 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical

Memory Bound: 44.1% of Pipeline Slots

 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.

    Cache Bound: 32.9% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from

     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 6.5% (2.330 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 3.2% (2.304 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.

     |
     | The code is latency bound, which means that there are a significant
     | fraction of cycles during which the code could be stalled due to main
     | memory latency. Consider optimizing data layout or using software
     | prefetches through the compiler to improve cache reuse and to reduce the
